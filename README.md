The zip file is for mac, you need to unzip it and setting up the system security to open it. And the exe file is for pc.

Since it's a two players version, you can play it with your friends.

The upper jet will be controlled by 'Enter'.The down jet will be controlled by 'Space'

If you have any suggestions. Just post it on the issues.

And I'll post the c# scripts in a few hours.

Have fun!

### version0.1: a basic game, adding score doesn't work well.

### version0.4: two controller players game, with adding score working well and coins and showing scores, etc. Still has bug to deal with.
